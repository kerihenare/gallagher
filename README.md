> The **Gallagher index** measures an electoral systemâ€™s relative disproportionality between votes received and seats allotted in a legislature. As such, it measures the difference between the percentage of votes each party gets, and the percentage of seats each party gets in the resulting legislature -- and it measures this dis-proportionality from all parties collectively in one given election. This collective dis-proportionality from this one election is given a precise score, which can then be used in comparing various levels of proportionality among various elections from various electoral systems.

## Use
```js
var gallagher = require('gallagher');

var parties = [
  { name: 'Party A', votes: 1058636, seats: 59 },
  { name: 'Party B', votes: 614937, seats: 34 },
  { name: 'Party C', votes: 247372, seats: 14 },
